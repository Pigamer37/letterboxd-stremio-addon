# letterboxd-stremio-addon
 Node.js addon trying to sync watched movies on Stremio with Letterboxd activity. (I'm new to backend so I'm using it as a learning experience)

Based on [Sagetendo's MAL-Stremio Addon](https://github.com/SageTendo/mal-stremio-addon), wich in turn bases itself on another utility.
