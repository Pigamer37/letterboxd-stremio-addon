# letterboxd-stremio-addon
 Node.js & Express based addon trying to sync watched movies on Stremio with Letterboxd activity. (I'm new to backend so I'm using it as a learning experience)

## Normal program flow:
Whenever you start watching something on Stremio that matches some parameters set in the manifest (generated on `index.js`), the platform will call this addon. When the program can get the data for the item you are watching, it will let you know by having a language entry in the subtitles that looks something like `LB-[source of data, either TMDB or the Cinemeta addon]OK`. When it can't get the data, the entry wont be available.
#### Future flow:
When getting the data correctly, which is necessary for the following steps, log activity on the user's Letterboxd account.<br>
Hypothetical: Update new Stremio Library items on Letterboxd's watchlist, or create a Stremio catalog based on the watchlist.

## Run locally:
> [!IMPORTANT]
> 0. Previous steps/requirements:
>  - This project runs on Node.js, so install both Node.js and the npm package manager
>  - You'll need to get all necessary API keys. Right now you only need to get keys for the TMDB API, which is free. In the future, you will probably need a Letterboxd API key too
>  - Enter those parameters inside a .env file like this (you don't need to install the dotenv npm package manually, the next steps will take care of project dependencies):
>    ```
>    TMDB_API_READ_TOKEN = "yourTMDBAPIkey"
>    LETTERBOXD_API_TOKEN = "yourLetterboxdAPIkey"
>    ```
1. Clone the repo/dowload the code on your machine however you like, and navigate to the project's directory (where `package.json` resides)
2. Run the following command to install all necessary dependencies based on `package.json`:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Run a local instance of the server.
> [!TIP]
> You can run a convenient instance of the project that will restart itself when you make changes to the files (after saving) using `nodemon`, with the preprogrammed devStart command (`nodemon index.js` under the hood) with:
> ```
> npm run devStart
> ```
5. Make requests to the app on localhost:3000 or by using Stremio

> This application/addon uses TMDB and the TMDB APIs but is not endorsed, certified, or otherwise approved by TMDB.

> In case TMDB doesn't work, the [Cinemeta Stremio Addon](https://v3-cinemeta.strem.io/) will be used to get the item's metadata

Based on [Sagetendo's MAL-Stremio Addon](https://github.com/SageTendo/mal-stremio-addon), wich in turn bases itself on another utility. Even if it uses a different language (Python) and thus different frameworks, it has been hugely helpful for understanding the flow and routing necessary to do this kind of thing. Thank you @SageTendo !

## TO DO:
- [ ] Get access to letterboxd API
- [ ] https://github.com/Pigamer37/letterboxd-stremio-addon/issues/5
- [ ] Configure DataBase (will probably use MongoDB, but feel free to recommend other options)
- [ ] https://github.com/Pigamer37/letterboxd-stremio-addon/issues/6

### Enhancements/new features
- [ ] Investigate Stremio API
- [ ] Create catalog based on the user's letterboxd watchlist, probably using [`stremio-imdb-list`](https://github.com/jaruba/stremio-imdb-watchlist?tab=readme-ov-file#4-proxy-a-different-add-on-to-get-list-responses-based-on-list-id)
